# ToolZoo

ToolZoo is our development tool to test aspects of Source Editor, from new fuctions to VGUI elements. You can think of this as a tool with a bunch of examples.

We don't recommend you edit this tool to create your own, however you can look at our SampleTool which gives you a framework to create your tools on.
