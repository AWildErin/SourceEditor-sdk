# SourceEditor

SourceEditor is my attempt at making an editor suite, similar to Unreal or Unity, but for Source 1. Currently our tools are built using Source SDK as it allows us to use Source and it's various libraries.

See our docs for information on how to build it, make your own tools and more.

## Why?
I got inspritation from the Source 2 tools and thought to myself "It'd be cool if something like that existed for Source 1" so I thought about this project and I started to do it.
I am in no way a professional programmer and my code is probably terrible, but it gets the job done and I can easily refactor it.

## Info
SourceEditor is licensed GNU GPL v3.0 license, you can find it's license [here](license_sourceeditor.md). As we are including Source SDK here, it is not licensed under GPL v3.0 it is instead under it's own license, which you can find [here](license_sourceengine.md).
